# Osprey Knockout - Fun photograhic competition

A head-head photographic competition - a different yet fun competition to get the whole club involved.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This is a piece of software that I wrote for Bishop's Waltham Photographic Society several years ago. We wanted something light hearted to do post AGM.  We hold our AGMs in January, so often images have a humourus Christmas flavour. 

All the members vote on the favourite images, until like in sporting events, you get to semi-finals, then the final. 
It's proved very enteraining evening and we intend to continue!

<div class="code-example">
Though we've been using this for some years; this is the software's first public release - both for the software and the documentation. Please be gentle - and please do get in touch.  I'd love other clubs to have the same fun interactive evenings we've had... so please do get in touch if you want to try this out.

The overview is...

3. start the software and point it at the images
4. See who wins!!

## Cost

This is open-source software - so has no charge.  And if you wish you can help contribute to it's development on [github](https://github.com/osprey-photo/osprey-knockout).

Though I will not complain if you wish to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/calanais)
